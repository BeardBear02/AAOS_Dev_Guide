6.1 If GM clears Your Application for distribution, You appoint GM and GM Representatives as Your agent to distribute Your Application and to take all actions necessary with regard to Your Application to distribute Your Application in any and all of the manners described in this Agreement and according to the terms of this Agreement and the AppShop Requirements. If distribution of Your Application is not free of charge, You and GM will work together to resolve the terms associated with any such charges, including revenue sharing, payment terms, and other related terms.

6.2 If GM clears Your Application for distribution, You hereby grant to GM and GM Representatives an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable right and license worldwide to use Your Application in source code and object code and to distribute your Application in object code as set forth in Section 5.11; this use includes the right to make, have made, host, copy, modify, create derivative works, improve, expand, update, make, display, perform and sublicense in any form or medium, whether now known or hereafter developed, Your Application in order to make it available to End Users using the branding provided by you or otherwise resolved in consultation with you. Other than any revenue sharing that is separately agreed by GM and You, GM will not be responsible for making any payment to you for the activities licensed in this Section.

6.3 You acknowledge and agree that the foregoing rights and licenses extend to any third party media contact, information materials or third party software that Your Application include, use, are derived from or based on, link to or provide access to.

7. No Other Distribution by You Except for distribution via GM as contemplated by this Agreement, You agree not to, and not to permit or enable others to, distribute or otherwise provide to any third parties any version of Your Application (or any other software) that You develop using the GM Software. This restriction will not apply to any version of Your Application (or any other software) that is not created, developed, modified or adapted using the GM Software.

8. Application Maintenance and Support

8.1 You shall be solely responsible to provide any and all documentation, user manuals or guides and all customer support for Your Application.

8.2 You agree and acknowledge that it is Your responsibility to ensure that Your Application including any installation of it, or any upgrades or updates, on any GM Connected Device, complies will all laws in any country in or from which it may be used, installed, upgraded, or updated. GM’s standard end user terms (the “GM Terms”) will apply to your relationship with End Users and create a contractual relationship between You and each End User of Your Application. The GM Terms are, subject to local legal requirements, consistent with the Standard End User License. If you, in your sole discretion, require additional terms to apply to End Users of your Application, then You may submit such additional terms for presentation to such End Users (“Your Additional Terms”). You will ensure that Your Additional Terms comply with the Documentation, comply with all applicable laws in all countries where the corresponding Application can be downloaded, installed, updated, or upgraded, are consistent with the GM Terms, and are consistent with the terms of this Agreement. If Your Additional Terms conflict with the GM Terms, then the GM Terms will govern. Without limiting the foregoing, the Application must describe the function and purpose of the Application, set out a valid mailing and email address for You, and obtain whatever consent may be required to allow for the installation of the Application on the GM Connected Device. You must also solicit and obtain whatever additional consent may be required to allow for the upgrade or update of the Application on the GM Connected Device. You must provide a resource to allow for the end user to print a copy of Your Additional Terms, if any. You appoint GM as Your agent to present the GM Terms and Your Additional Terms on behalf of You to the end user. Although GM facilitates Your licensing of the Application to the End User, GM has no responsibilities to You or the End User in relation to Your Application, except as otherwise expressly provided under this Agreement. Any end user license agreement for Your Application (including the GM Terms and Your Additional Terms) is binding solely between You and the End User.

8.3 You agree that GM and its subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of any end user license agreement for Your Application and thus GM can enforce the end user license agreement against an End User of Your Application, provided that if the doctrine of third-party beneficiaries is found to not apply for any reason, the parties acknowledge and agree that while GM is not a party to the end user license agreement and has no obligations under the end user license agreement, You will be a trustee of GM for the limited purpose of holding in trust for GM the covenants in favor of GM. Accordingly, GM will be able to enforce such rights and promises in its own right (without being required to add You as a party to any proceedings for such enforcement).

9. Fees

You shall update GM on an ongoing basis and cooperate fully with any related GM investigation, requests for information, or End User or other notices that GM may require of You.

For the avoidance of doubt, Submissions do not include Your Applications.

11.2 Because many applications and potential applications may be similar to Your Applications and potential Applications, much of the information that we receive from You and others may be similar. Because of this, and to avoid any misunderstandings, You agree that Your submission to GM or any GM Representative of information and materials under this Agreement or in any way connected to the GM Software, Documentation or AppShop, including the Application and Submissions, creates no confidentiality obligation on the part of GM or any GM Representative in any way and You acknowledge that GM does not consider such information or materials confidential.

19. Disputes; Binding Individual Arbitration; Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver.

(a) Our customer service department is available to address any concerns you may have regarding the AppShop or the Products. You may call us at: 1-855-440-0400, email us at infotainment@gmexpert.com or contact us by regular mail at the addresses listed at the end of this Agreement. Most matters are quickly resolved in this manner to our customer’s satisfaction. Any matter we are unable to resolve and all disputes or claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its formation, enforceability, performance, or breach (each, a "License Claim"), with the exception of the matters described in Section 19(c) below, shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for customer-related disputes, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all License Claims. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties expressly waive the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. Any arbitration will be conducted by the parties in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in the preceding sentence is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth in this Section 19 shall be null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate License Claims.

(b) The rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879. To the extent the initial filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the initial filing fee for a lawsuit, we will pay the difference in fees.

(c) Section 19(a) does not apply to any License Claim (i) in which a party is attempting to protect its intellectual property rights (such as its patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or moral rights, but not including its privacy or publicity rights), or (ii) that may be brought in small-claims court.

20. Applicable law and time limit for filing. To the extent permitted by law and unless prohibited by law, this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Michigan, except in relation to any conflict of law provisions thereof which would require application of another choice of law. If you are a public educational institution in the United States within state that requires applicability of one or more laws of your state, then those laws of your state shall apply. To the extent permitted by law and unless prohibited by law, You agree that you must file any arbitration request, claim, or cause of action arising out of or related to the Product or this License within one (1) year after the events giving rise to the arbitration request, claim, or cause of action, or you shall be forever barred from filing such request, claim, or cause of action.This Agreement shall not be subject to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.

21. Export compliance. You will comply worldwide with all laws and regulations applicable to the Product. You may not use, export, re-export, import, sell, or transfer the Product except as authorized by United States law and any other applicable laws and regulations. In particular, but without limitation, the Product may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List. By using the Product, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You also agree that you will not use the Product for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture, or production of nuclear, missiles, or chemical or biological weapons.

22. Federal Acquisitions. If you are acting on behalf of the U.S. federal government or under any activity directed or controlled by the federal government, then the Product shall be considered commercial computer software under 48 C.F.R. Chapter 2.

23. Notices. Provider may provide you with notices regarding the Product, including changes to this License, by email to your mail address associated with your GM account if available, by regular mail, or by postings on the AppShop.

24. Miscellaneous. You may not assign this License without permission of Provider. You, Provider and GM are independent contracting parties. If the Product is provided to you by a third party Provider, you agree that GM and its subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of the License and thus GM or its subsidiaries can enforce this License against you even if it is not the Provider of the Product provided that if the doctrine of third-party beneficiaries is found to not apply for any reason, the parties acknowledge and agree that while GM is not a party to this License and has no obligations under this License, the Provider is a trustee of GM for the limited purpose of holding in trust for GM the covenants in favour of GM. Accordingly, the parties agree that GM may enforce such rights and agreements in its own right (without being required to add the Provider as a party to any proceedings for such enforcement). If any term of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, then it shall be severed from this Agreement and the remainder of the agreement shall remain in full force and effect. If Section 19 is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then for any License Claims the parties consent to personal jurisdiction and exclusive venue in the state and federal courts of the Eastern District of Michigan. No condition of this License shall be deemed waived unless waived in writing by the party claimed to have waived. This License is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter, and there are no other representations, understandings or agreements between the parties relative to such subject matter. You cannot change this License unless Provider agrees in writing to the change. Provider may modify this License by providing notice to you, and if you do not agree with any modification, then you must stop using the Product. Your continued use of the Product will be deemed acceptance of such modifications.</license>
